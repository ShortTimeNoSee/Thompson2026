            <p>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the People to cast off the shackles of bloated government and reclaim the freedoms that are rightfully theirs, a bold declaration of purpose must be made.</p>

            <p>We, the undersigned, standing in firm opposition to the unrelenting encroachment of government overreach, do hereby declare a state of war. This is a war of principle, not violence, against every institution and practice that strips us of our liberty.</p>

            <p><strong>Whereas</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The government has grown far beyond its intended purpose, reaching into the lives, businesses, and personal choices of every citizen through excessive taxation, endless regulation, and unjust laws that serve only to expand its own power;</li>
                
                <li>The People have a natural, inalienable right to govern themselves, free from the intrusion of bureaucrats and lawmakers who impose their will upon the individual under the false banner of "public good";</li>
                
                <li>Government exists solely to protect life, liberty, and property. It was never meant to dictate our daily lives or serve as a tool for special interests and corrupt power brokers;</li>
                
                <li>Every individual possesses the absolute right to pursue their own happiness without interference, provided they respect the equal rights of others. Government's only role is to protect this right, not suffocate it with arbitrary restrictions;</li>
                
                <li>California has devolved into a breeding ground for overregulation, crushing taxation, and bureaucratic interference that enriches the political class while impoverishing the people.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Therefore</strong>, we, the People of California, declare war on government overreach in all its forms. We do so with the following aims:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To reject and repeal all laws that unjustly infringe on individual liberty and personal responsibility, and to limit the government's reach into the lives of its citizens;</li>
                
                <li>To dismantle the unnecessary bureaucracies that waste resources, time, and money while serving no purpose beyond their own perpetuation;</li>
                
                <li>To defend the right of every individual to make choices for themselves, without interference from a government that presumes to know better;</li>
                
                <li>To champion the principles of free markets, free speech, and personal sovereignty, and to restore power to the hands of the People, where it belongs.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let it be known that from this day forward, the people of California will no longer tolerate a government that seeks to expand its influence through coercion, taxation, and control.</p>

            <p>We are not subjects to be ruled, but citizens with the right to choose our own paths. We will resist every attempt to strip us of our freedoms. We will stand as living proof of what happens when government steps back and lets the people thrive.</p>

            <p><strong>Signed this day, and every day forward, by the free people of California, in unwavering commitment to liberty.</strong></p>

            <p>Let this declaration and the signatures below serve as a warning to those in power: The era of unchecked government expansion ends now. The People are awake, and we will fight for the rights that are inherently ours.</p>
