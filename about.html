                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Nicholas Thompson grew up in Chico, California, and his passion for politics started when he realized how much government overreach was holding people back. Watching flawed laws pass with little accountability pushed him to step up and fight for real change.</p>
                    <p>He's not a career politician — he's someone who values hard work, resilience, and straight talk. Nicholas believes in <strong>freedom over control</strong>, and his approach to politics is simple: let people thrive without unnecessary interference.</p>
                    <p>When he's not on the campaign trail, you'll find him running, cycling, or spending time with the people who keep him grounded.</p>
                    <p>Nicholas is running for Governor in 2026 because he believes Californians deserve leadership that works for them — not the other way around.</p>

            <h3>Why Experience Isn't Everything</h3>
            <div class="speech-text">
                <p>Here's the thing: I'm not a career politician. I'm not someone who's spent years playing the game, making deals, or climbing the political ladder. And I'm not going to pretend that I am. <strong>But that's a good thing.</strong></p>
                <p>Let's break it down. The governor of California has the power to veto bills from the legislature. That's a big deal, but it's also pretty straightforward. The governor's role here is to protect the people from bad laws, not to push for more. You don't need years of political maneuvering to know when to veto a bill that overreaches or undermines our freedoms. You just need a strong commitment to liberty and a clear understanding that the government should be doing less, not more.</p>
                <p>Look at the other responsibilities of the governor: granting pardons, commuting sentences, commanding the state militia, appointing officials to vacancies, and having a vote on the University of California's governing board. These are important duties, but they're also duties that require restraint, not activism. The governor should be using these powers sparingly, only when absolutely necessary, to ensure justice is served and liberty is preserved.</p>
                <p>So why do so many believe experience is necessary? The truth is, it's not. What we need is a governor who knows what to block, not what to push through. We need someone who will stand firm against unnecessary government expansion and keep the state out of your business as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Every year, the governor gives a State of the State address. I can tell you right now, if I'm giving that address, it'll be short. The state doesn't need more government intervention. What it needs is to get out of your way and let you live your life. That's what I'll be focused on — protecting your freedom, not expanding government power.</p>
                <p>In reality, the governor shouldn't be doing as much as they are today. The office is there to protect against bad laws and bad decisions, not to be a platform for pushing new agendas. That's why I don't need years of political experience. What I need — and what I have — is a commitment to keeping the government out of your life as much as possible.</p>
                <p>I'm not running for governor to gain power. I'm running to make sure power stays where it belongs: with you, the people. You deserve a governor who understands that their role is to protect your freedom, not to dictate how you live. That's what I'm offering — a commitment to less government, more liberty, and a state that stays out of your way.</p>
                <p>So no, I'm not a politician with decades of experience. But I know what needs to be done, and more importantly, what doesn't. And that's why I'm running for governor of California.</p>
