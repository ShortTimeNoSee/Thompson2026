                    <p>Nicholas A. Thompson is a passionate advocate for liberty, individual rights, and transparent governance. Born and raised in California, Nicholas has dedicated his life to fighting for the freedoms that allow all Californians to thrive.</p>
                    <p>Nicholas understands the challenges facing Californians today. His campaign for Governor in 2026 is rooted in the belief that government should serve the people by protecting their rights, not by limiting their potential.</p>
                    <p>As Governor, Nicholas aims to reduce unnecessary regulations, lower taxes, and ensure that every Californian has the opportunity to succeed based on their own merits. His vision for California is one where innovation flourishes, communities are empowered, and the government respects the personal freedoms of all individuals.</p>
                    <p>Nicholas's leadership is defined by a commitment to transparency, accountability, and a deep respect for the principles of liberty that have made California a beacon of opportunity.</p>

            <h3>Why Experience Isn't Everything</h3>
            <div class="speech-text">
                <p>Here's the thing: I'm not a career politician. I'm not someone who's spent years playing the game, making deals, or climbing the political ladder. And I'm not going to pretend that I am. But here's why that's actually a good thing — and why I believe the governor's office shouldn't need someone with all that experience anyway.</p>
                <p>Let's break it down. The governor of California has the power to veto bills from the legislature. That's a big deal, but it's also pretty straightforward. The governor's role here is to protect the people from bad laws, not to push for more. You don't need years of political maneuvering to know when to veto a bill that overreaches or undermines our freedoms. You just need a strong commitment to liberty and a clear understanding that the government should be doing less, not more.</p>
                <p>So why do so many believe experience is necessary? The truth is, it's not. What we need is a governor who knows what to block, not what to push through. We need someone who will stand firm against unnecessary government expansion and keep the state out of your business as much as possible.</p>
                <p>Look at the other responsibilities of the governor: granting pardons, commuting sentences, commanding the state militia, appointing officials to vacancies, and having a vote on the University of California's governing board. These are important duties, but they're also duties that require restraint, not activism. The governor should be using these powers sparingly, only when absolutely necessary, to ensure justice is served and liberty is preserved.</p>
                <p>Every year, the governor gives a State of the State address. I can tell you right now, if I'm giving that address, it'll be short. The state doesn't need more government intervention. What it needs is to get out of your way and let you live your life. That's what I'll be focused on — protecting your freedom, not expanding government power.</p>
                <p>In reality, the governor shouldn't be doing as much as they are today. The office is there to protect against bad laws and bad decisions, not to be a platform for pushing new agendas. That's why I don't need years of political experience. What I need — and what I have — is a commitment to keeping the government out of your life as much as possible.</p>
                <p>I'm not running for governor to gain power. I'm running to make sure power stays where it belongs: with you, the people. You deserve a governor who understands that their role is to protect your freedom, not to dictate how you live. That's what I'm offering — a commitment to less government, more liberty, and a state that stays out of your way.</p>
                <p>So no, I'm not a politician with decades of experience. But I know what needs to be done, and more importantly, what doesn't. And that's why I'm running for governor of California.</p>
