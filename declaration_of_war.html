            <h3>Declaration of War</h3>
            <p><strong><i>By the People of California, for the People of California</i></strong></p>
            <p>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the People to cast off the shackles of bloated government and reclaim the freedoms that are rightfully theirs, a bold declaration of purpose must be made.</p>

            <p>We, the undersigned, in firm opposition to the unrelenting encroachment of government overreach, do hereby declare a state of war — a war of principle, not violence — on the institutions and practices that strip us of our liberty.</p>

            <p><strong>Whereas</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The government, by its very nature, has grown far beyond its intended purpose, reaching into the lives, businesses, and personal choices of every citizen, placing undue burdens upon them in the form of excessive taxation, endless regulation, and unjust laws;</li>
                <li>The People have a natural, inalienable right to govern themselves, free from the intrusion of overzealous lawmakers, bureaucrats, and those who would impose their will upon the individual under the guise of "public good";</li>
                <li>The purpose of government, as originally intended, was to protect life, liberty, and property, not to dictate the minutiae of daily life or to serve as an engine for special interests and corrupt power brokers;</li>
                <li>Every man and woman possesses the right to pursue their own happiness, provided they do not infringe upon the equal rights of others, and the role of government should be to safeguard that right — not to impose arbitrary restrictions that stifle innovation, personal freedom, or economic opportunity;</li>
                <li>This great state of California has become a breeding ground for overregulation, high taxation, and a labyrinth of bureaucratic interference that serves only to enrich the political class while impoverishing the people;</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Therefore</strong>,<br />we, the People of California, declare war on government overreach in all its forms. We do so with the following aims:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>To reject and repeal all laws that unjustly infringe on individual liberty and personal responsibility, and to limit the government's reach into the lives of its citizens;</li>
                <li>To dismantle the unnecessary bureaucracies that waste resources, time, and money, and that serve no higher purpose than to sustain themselves at the expense of the public;</li>
                <li>To defend the right of every individual to make choices for themselves, without interference from a government that presumes to know better;</li>
                <li>To champion the principles of free markets, free speech, and personal sovereignty, and to restore power to the hands of the People, where it belongs.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let it be known, from this day forward, that the people of California will no longer tolerate a government that seeks to expand its influence through coercion, taxation, and control.</p>

            <p>We are not subjects to be ruled, but citizens with the right to choose our own paths. We will resist every attempt to strip us of our freedoms, and we will stand as a testament to what can be achieved when government steps back and lets the people thrive.</p>

            <p><strong>Signed this day, by the free people of California, in unwavering commitment to liberty.</strong></p>

            <p>Let this declaration serve as a warning to those in power: The era of unchecked government expansion is over. The People are awake, and we are prepared to fight for the rights that are inherently ours.</p>
