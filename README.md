## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShortTimeNoSee/Thompson2026.git
   ```

2. For local development, you can use:
   - VS Code with Live Server extension (see configuration below)
   - Any other local server solution

### VS Code Live Server Configuration

To properly handle URL routing in VS Code's Live Server:

1. Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl` + `,`)
2. Click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top right
3. Add or update the following configuration:

```json
{
    "liveServer.settings.mount": [
        ["/about", "./about.html"],
        ["/contact", "./contact.html"],
        ["/issues", "./issues.html"],
        ["/ ", "./index.html"],
        ["/sitemap", "./sitemap.html"],
        ["/vision", "./vision.html"]
    ]
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- The space in `"/ "` is required to prevent CSS/JS breaking on other pages
- Pages listed after the `"/"` line will redirect to `"/"`
- Order matters for proper routing
