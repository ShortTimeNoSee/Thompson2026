## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShortTimeNoSee/Thompson2026.git
   ```

2. For local development, you can use:
   - VS Code with Live Server extension (see configuration below)
   - Any other local server solution

### VS Code Live Server Configuration

To properly handle URL routing in VS Code's Live Server:

1. Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl` + `,`)
2. Click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top right
3. Add or update the following configuration:

```json
{
    "liveServer.settings.mount": [
        ["/about", "./about.html"],
        ["/contact", "./contact.html"],
        ["/issues", "./issues.html"],
        ["/ ", "./index.html"],
        ["/sitemap", "./sitemap.html"],
        ["/vision", "./vision.html"]
    ]
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- The space in `"/ "` is required to prevent CSS/JS breaking on other pages
- Pages listed after the `"/"` line will redirect to `"/"`
- Order matters for proper routing

### Declaration of War Feature Setup

The interactive Declaration of War feature requires some additional setup:

1. Create a Cloudflare Workers KV namespace:
   ```bash
   wrangler kv:namespace create "DECLARATION_KV"
   ```

2. Copy wrangler.toml.example to wrangler.toml and update with your KV namespace ID

3. Set up your environment variables in Cloudflare:
   - Go to Workers & Pages
   - Select your worker
   - Navigate to Settings > Variables
   - Add the required environment variables

### Security Note
Never commit sensitive information like API keys or KV namespace IDs to the repository. Use environment variables and the Cloudflare dashboard for configuration.

### Local Development
For local development, create a .env.local file with your development variables:
```bash
DECLARATION_KV_ID=your_kv_id
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```
