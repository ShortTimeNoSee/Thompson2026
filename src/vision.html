            <h1>Imagine a California<br>where you're actually free.</h1>
            <p class="vision-lead">Not the fake freedom they talk about in Sacramento. Real freedom. Your life. Your choices. Your future.</p>

                <h2>Your Life. Your Rules.</h2>
                <p>No more begging bureaucrats for permission to start a business. No more regulations telling you how to live. No more politicians who think they own you. Just you, building your life the way you see fit.</p>

                <h2>Innovation Without Permission</h2>
                <p>Remember when California led the world in innovation? We can do it again. Not by government programs, but by getting government out of the way. Let creators create. Let builders build.</p>

                <p>Sacramento treats your wallet like their personal ATM. Imagine keeping what you earn instead of funding their pet projects and bloated bureaucracies. Your money should work for you, not them.</p>

                <h2>Real Solutions. Real Results.</h2>
                <p>We don't need more laws. We need fewer. We don't need more regulators. We need more freedom. We don't need their permission to build a better California. We just need them to get out of our way.</p>
