                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>To get on the ballot, I need to either <strong>pay ~$5,000</strong> OR turn in <strong>6,000 signatures</strong>. Each signature is worth approximately $0.82.</p>
                <p>Usually, rich campaigns hire people to collect these signatures. We're doing something different.</p>
                <p><strong>We're letting YOU become the circulator.</strong></p>
                <p>Download the official legal petition. Sign it at home. If you can, get your roommates, neighbors, or friends to sign it. Then drop it off yourself at your county registrar's office.</p>
                <p class="groundbreaking">You can circulate your own signature. You sign as your own witness. Groundbreaking if we can pull this off.</p>

                <p>Most campaigns pay professionals per signature to collect these. That creates a barrier where only wealthy candidates or those backed by big donors can get on the ballot.</p>
                <p><strong>We're crowdsourcing the bureaucracy.</strong></p>
                <p>You're not just a voter. You're an active agent in tearing down the barriers that keep independent candidates off the ballot.</p>
                <p>Every petition you submit is worth ~$0.82 to the campaign. But more importantly, it's a statement that democracy shouldn't have a paywall! We're all in this together.</p>

                        <p>All signatures on one petition form must be from the same county. But you can print multiple forms for different counties if you know people spread across California. Just note you'll have to drop off each form separately in each county!</p>
