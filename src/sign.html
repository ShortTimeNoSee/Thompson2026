                <h2>Why Signatures Instead of Cash</h2>
                <p>California gives candidates two options: <strong>pay $5,000</strong> or collect <strong>6,000 signatures</strong> from registered voters.</p>
                <p>Most campaigns write the check. It's faster, cleaner, and requires no grassroots support. The state prefers it that way. A filing fee keeps the ballot limited to candidates who can afford the entry price or have donors willing to pay it.</p>
                <p>I'm taking the other path. Signatures prove something a check never will, that real people want these conversation on the ballot.</p>
                <p><strong>You can circulate your own petition.</strong> Download it, sign it as a voter, sign it again as the circulator, and drop it at your county registrar. One person, two signatures, zero dollars. That's the loophole they didn't think anyone would use.</p>
                <p>This is a test case. If we can get 6,000 Californians to print a PDF and walk it into their county office, we prove you don't need to be wealthy or connected to challenge the establishment. Every signature is a statement that ballot access should require support, not payment.</p>
                <div class="clarification-box">
                    <p><strong>Signing this petition does NOT mean you're voting for me.</strong> It means you think voters deserve the option to hear from candidates who won't pay the entry fee. Any party, any ideology. If you believe the ballot shouldn't be for sale, sign it.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>The $5,000 filing fee exists to filter the ballot. It keeps out candidates who can't write a check or convince donors to write it for them. The signature option exists as a legal alternative, but most campaigns ignore it because hiring professionals to collect signatures costs more than just paying the fee.</p>
                <p><strong>That's the barrier.</strong> Not the $5,000 itself, but the assumption that only candidates with money or institutional backing can clear it.</p>
                <p>If 6,000 Californians can print a PDF, walk it into their county office, and get me on the ballot without a dollar changing hands, we prove the system can be beaten. We demonstrate that ballot access can be earned through actual support instead of purchased through wealth.</p>
                <p>This isn't about me winning. It's about breaking the model that says you need to be rich or connected to even get in the race.</p>

                        <h4>What happens to my signature and personal info?</h4>
                        <p>It goes <strong>directly to your county registrar</strong>, a government office, not my campaign. This is not a mailing list. We never see your information if you submit your own petition. It's used solely to verify you're a registered voter.</p>

                        <h4>Does my party affiliation matter?</h4>
                        <p>Not at all. Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, independents, anyone registered to vote in California can sign. Ballot access petitions are non-partisan.</p>

                        <h4>Do I need to be a registered voter to circulate?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, you must be a registered California voter to sign. But you can circulate your own signature, so if you can sign, you can circulate.</p>

                        <h4>Can I get signatures from people in other counties?</h4>
                        <p>All signatures on one petition form must be from the same county. But you can print multiple forms for different counties if you know people spread across California. Just note you'll have to drop off each form separately in each county!</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What if I mess up the form?</h4>
                        <p>Just print another one! The PDF is free to download and print as many times as you need.</p>

                        <h4>Do I really need to print it double-sided?</h4>
                        <p>YES. This is a requirement. Single-sided printing will result in rejection. Follow the manual flip instructions if you don't have a duplex printer.</p>

                        <h4>Can I mail it instead of dropping it off?</h4>
                        <p>Not right now. We're still confirming mailing protocols with county registrars. For now, please drop it off in person to ensure it's properly received.</p>
