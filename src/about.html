                    <h3>The Reality</h3>
                    <p>Sacramento thinks it owns you. They regulate how you live, work, and even breathe. They treat your rights like privileges they can revoke whenever they want.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Message</h3>
                    <p>This campaign is a wake-up call. A reminder that power belongs to the people, not the bureaucrats who think they can run your life better than you can.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Goal</h3>
                    <p>To prove that Californians are done with the status quo. We're tired of being treated like subjects instead of citizens. It's time for real change.</p>

                <h3>Individual Rights</h3>
                <p>Your rights aren't up for debate or subject to majority vote. They're yours, period. The state needs to back off and let you live your life.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Economic Freedom</h3>
                <p>Sacramento's regulations are suffocating small businesses while big corporations write the rules. Time to level the playing field and let people build their dreams.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>State Overreach</h3>
                <p>The state has no business in your personal choices, your wallet, or your property. They work for us, not the other way around. Time to remind them of that.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Real Transparency</h3>
                <p>No more backroom deals. No more hidden agendas. Every Californian deserves to see exactly how their money is being wasted by Sacramento.</p>

                <p>Look, I get it. You're probably thinking: "Another politician making promises." But I'm not here to promise you anything except this: I'll be the brick wall between you and a government that can't stop trying to control your life.</p>
                <p>The career politicians in Sacramento are experts at one thing: making your life more complicated while padding their own pockets. Every year they pass hundreds of new laws telling you what you can and can't do with your own life.</p>
                <p>This campaign isn't about winning a cushy job in Sacramento. It's about sending a message: Californians are done being treated like subjects in their own state.</p>
                <p>You don't need a politician to run your life. You need someone who'll tell Sacramento to back off and let you run it yourself.</p>
