            <blockquote>
                <p>"The right to privacy is not about having something to hide. It's about having something to protect: your autonomy, your dignity, and your freedom to think and act without surveillance."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As a libertarian campaign, we believe your personal information is your property. We collect only what's necessary to communicate with supporters and run an effective campaign. We're transparent about what we collect because you deserve to know. We do not monetize your data because that would make us no better than the surveillance state we're running against.</p>
