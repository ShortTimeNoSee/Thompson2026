# Chapter 7: Communications (Ads, Mailers, and Social Media)

**Official Source:** [Chapter 7 - Communications](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-7-Communications.pdf)

## Introduction
"Communications" is the bureaucratic term for talking to voters. This includes TV ads, mailers, billboards, text blasts, and social media posts.

The Political Reform Act doesn't just care *what* you say; it cares **who paid for it** and **who decided to say it**.

Depending on those two factors, a communication falls into one of three buckets:
1.  **Direct Expenditure:** You (the candidate) pay for your own ads.
2.  **Non-Monetary Contribution:** Someone else pays for an ad, but you helped (coordinated).
3.  **Independent Expenditure:** Someone else pays for an ad, and you had absolutely nothing to do with it.

## Bucket 1: You Pay (Direct Campaign Expenditures)
This is the standard scenario. Your committee pays a printer to send a flyer.
* **Reporting:** You report this as a standard expenditure on **Schedule E** of your **Form 460**.
* **Rule:** Straightforward. Just ensure you follow the "Paid for by" disclosure rules (covered in Chapter 8).

---

## Bucket 2: They Pay, You Help (Coordinated Communications)
If a supporter (individual, business, or another committee) pays for a communication that supports you, and they do it **"at your behest,"** the law treats it exactly as if they gave you the cash and you spent it yourself.

**"At Your Behest" = Coordination.**
This counts as a **Non-Monetary (In-Kind) Contribution**.
* **The Trap:** Because it is a contribution, it counts toward your **contribution limits**. If a wealthy supporter spends $10,000 on a mailer you requested, and the limit is $5,500, you have just broken the law.

### What Counts as "Coordination"?
You are coordinating if you (or your agents):
1.  Requested or suggested the ad.
2.  Consulted on the content, timing, or audience.
3.  Provided information about your campaign needs/plans to the spender.

**The "Danger Zone" (Presumption of Coordination)**
The FPPC assumes you coordinated (even if you claim you didn't) in these specific scenarios:
* **Agents:** The spender acts through your current campaign agent.
* **Common Consultants:** The spender hires a consultant who is also working on your campaign strategy.
* **Republication:** The spender takes your video footage or graphics and simply republishes them.
* **Fundraising:** The spender is a committee formed to support you, and you show up to their fundraiser.
* **Former Staff:** The spender is run by someone who was your senior staffer within the last 12 months.
* **Family:** The spender is funded or run by your immediate family.

## Bucket 3: They Pay, You Don't Help (Independent Expenditures)
An **Independent Expenditure (IE)** happens when a third party spends money to support you (or attack your opponent) **without** any cooperation, consultation, or request from your campaign.

* **Reporting:** **You (the candidate) do NOT report this.** The person spending the money must file their own reports.
* **Limits:** There are **no limits** on Independent Expenditures. A Super PAC can spend $1 million supporting you, as long as they don't talk to you about it.

### What qualifies as an IE?
1.  **No Coordination:** Absolutely zero communication between the spender and the candidate regarding the ad.
2.  **Express Advocacy:** The ad must clearly tell voters how to vote (e.g., "Vote for Smith," "Defeat Jones," "Support Prop 1").

**"Express Advocacy" Defined:**
It counts as express advocacy if it uses "Magic Words" (Vote For, Elect, Cast your ballot, Reject) **OR** if, taken as a whole, it unambiguously urges a specific result in an election within 60 days of the vote.

## The "Issue Ad" (Form E-530)
Sometimes groups run ads that feature a candidate but don't explicitly say "Vote For." These are often called "Issue Ads" (e.g., "Call Senator Jones and tell him to stop hurting the environment").

**The Trigger Rule:**
If a committee spends **$50,000 or more** on a communication that:
1.  Clearly identifies a state candidate.
2.  Does **not** expressly advocate (no "Vote For").
3.  Is disseminated within **45 days** of an election.

**Action Plan:**
The group spending the money must file **Form E-530** with the Secretary of State within **48 hours**.

## Specific Communication Scenarios

### 1. Endorsements
* **Oral Endorsement:** If a Senator stands up at a meeting and says, "I endorse Jane," that costs nothing. It is **not** a contribution.
* **Paid Advertisement:** If the Senator pays to print a flyer announcing the endorsement, that payment **is** a contribution to Jane (unless it's an Independent Expenditure).
* **Ballotmate Exception:** If you pay for a mailer promoting yourself, and you list your endorsement of another candidate (e.g., "Jane supports Governor Smith"), it is **not** a contribution to Governor Smith if:
    1.  Smith didn't request it.
    2.  Smith appears on the same ballot.
    3.  It is sent only to your own potential voters.

### 2. The Internet & Social Media
* **Paid Ads:** If you pay Facebook or Google to boost a post, it is a reportable expenditure.
* **Uncompensated Individuals (The Safe Harbor):** If a volunteer or supporter posts, blogs, or tweets about you for free, it is **not** a contribution. This applies even if they use your photos or logos.
* **Paid Bloggers/Influencers:** If you pay an influencer to post about you, you must report that payment.

### 3. Debates & Meetings
* **Debates:** If a nonpartisan group (like League of Women Voters) hosts a debate and invites at least two opposing candidates, the cost of the event is **not** a contribution.
* **Meetings:** If a trade union or business invites you to speak at a regularly scheduled meeting, the overhead cost (coffee, room rental) is **not** a contribution.

### 4. Member Communications
This is a powerful tool for unions and associations.
* **Internal:** If a union sends a mailer *only* to its own members supporting a candidate, it is **not** a contribution and **not** an expenditure. It is effectively "invisible" money.
* **External:** If that union sends the same mailer to the general public, it becomes a **contribution** (if coordinated) or an **Independent Expenditure** (if not).

### 5. News Stories
If a newspaper writes an editorial endorsing you, it is **not** a contribution. This is the "media exemption."

## Action Plan: Classifying a Communication

When a third party wants to help your campaign, ask these questions to determine how to handle it:

| Question | If Yes... | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Did the candidate ask for it?** | **YES** | **Non-Monetary Contribution.** (Subject to limits). |
| **Did the candidate discuss details?** | **YES** | **Non-Monetary Contribution.** |
| **Is it a paid ad on the internet?** | **YES** | **Expenditure.** (Must be reported). |
| **Is it a volunteer posting for free?** | **YES** | **Not Reportable.** (Safe harbor). |
| **Is it a union mailing ONLY to members?** | **YES** | **Not Reportable.** (Member comms exception). |
| **Is it a Super PAC acting alone?** | **YES** | **Independent Expenditure.** (Candidate reports nothing). |

## FAQ: Common Stumbling Blocks

**Q: A supporter wants to buy a billboard for me. Can they?**
A: Only if the cost of the billboard fits within their contribution limit (e.g., $5,500). If you talk to them about the billboard (location, design), it is a coordinated contribution. If the billboard costs $10,000, they cannot do it in coordination with you without breaking the law. They would have to do it as an Independent Expenditure (no talking to you).

**Q: Can I share my campaign photos with a Super PAC?**
A: Be very careful. If a Super PAC uses your photos, it *might* be considered independent, but if you gave them the photos *for the purpose* of the ad, it is coordination. However, if they simply download high-res photos you put on your public website for everyone to use, that is generally allowed.

**Q: I am being interviewed by a group that might spend money on me. Is that coordination?**
A: No. Merely being interviewed by a group (e.g., for an endorsement) does not make their subsequent spending "coordinated." Just don't discuss their ad buy or strategy during the interview.

**Q: My neighbor is a web designer. She wants to build my website for free. Is that a contribution?**
A: No. Uncompensated personal services are volunteered time, not contributions.
