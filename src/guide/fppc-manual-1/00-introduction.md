# Chapter 0: Introduction & How to Use This Guide

**Official Source:** [Introduction (FPPC Manual 1)](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Introduction.pdf)

## Welcome to the Plain-English Guide
Running for office in California involves navigating the **Political Reform Act** (the "Act"). The state takes this very seriously. The goal of the Act is simple: **Transparency.**

Voters have the right to know who is paying for political messages so they can make informed decisions. To ensure this, the state requires accurate, timely, and transparent disclosure of all money raised and spent.

This guide translates the bureaucratic requirements of the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) **Manual 1** into actionable steps. It is designed for grassroots campaigns, independent candidates, and anyone engaging in the political process who does not have a team of specialized lawyers on retainer.

### Important Disclaimer
While this guide aims to be as helpful and accurate as possible, it is a simplified resource.
* **Controlling Law:** If there is ever a difference between this guide and the Political Reform Act (or its regulations), the Act always wins.
* **Updates:** The law changes. Since 1974, there have been over 200 amendments. Always verify current rules on the FPPC website.

## Does This Manual Apply to You?
Before you read further, you must determine if you are in the right place. **Manual 1** (and this guide) covers specific types of candidates and committees.

### The "Yes" Checklist
You are in the right place if you are:
1.  **A State or Statewide Candidate:** This includes candidates for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Senate, State Assembly, etc.
2.  **A CalPERS or CalSTRS Candidate:** Someone seeking election to the Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System or the Teachers' Retirement Board.
3.  **A Primarily Formed Committee:** A group formed specifically to support or oppose one of the candidates listed above.

### The "No" Checklist
**Stop reading** if you are:
* **A Local Candidate:** If you are running for City Council, School Board, County Supervisor, or other local offices, this is the wrong manual. You need **FPPC Campaign Disclosure Manual 2**.
