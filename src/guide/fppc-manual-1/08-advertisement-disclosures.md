# Chapter 8: Advertisement Disclosures ("Paid for by...")

**Official Source:** [Chapter 8 - Advertisement Disclosures](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-8-Ad-Disclosures.pdf)

## Introduction
In California politics, voters have a legal right to know who is paying for the political messages they see and hear. Whether it is a TV commercial, a stack of mailers, or a robocall, the law requires a "disclosure statement" (commonly known as the **"Paid for by"** line).

This chapter explains exactly what words you must put on your ads to avoid fines. The rules differ significantly depending on whether you are the **Candidate** (running your own ads) or an **Independent Committee** (supporting/opposing a candidate).

**The Golden Rule:** Transparency. When in doubt, disclose who paid for it.

## Part A: Rules for Candidate Controlled Committees
These rules apply when **you** (the candidate) are paying for ads to support your **own** election. The rules are generally less strict than for independent groups because voters assume a candidate's ad is paid for by that candidate.

### 1. What Requires a Disclosure?
You **MUST** include a disclosure on:
* **Mass Mailings:** More than 200 pieces of substantially similar mail sent in a calendar month.
* **Mass Emails:** More than 200 substantially similar emails sent in a calendar month.
* **Radio & TV Ads.**
* **Robocalls:** 500 or more similar calls.

### 2. What DOES NOT Require a Disclosure?
Surprisingly, the state does **not** legally require a disclosure on the following for *candidate* campaigns (though it is highly recommended to include it anyway to avoid confusion):
* Yard Signs.
* Billboards.
* Door Hangers.
* Flyers (unless mailed).
* Small items (buttons, pins, pens, magnets, t-shirts).
* Skywriting.

### 3. The Specific "Paid for By" Rules

#### Postal Mail (Mass Mailings)
If you send more than 200 pieces of mail:
* **Wording:** Must say "Paid for by [Committee Name]" and include the committee's street address (or city/state/zip if the street address is on your Form 410).
* **Placement:** Must be on the **outside** of the mailing (e.g., the envelope or the address panel of a postcard).
* **Format:** Must be in at least **6-point type** and in a color that contrasts with the background (e.g., no light blue text on a blue background).

#### Emails
* **Wording:** "Paid for by [Committee Name]".
* **Format:** Must be the same size font as the majority of the text in the email. Can be at the top or bottom.

#### Telephone Calls (Robocalls)
If you pay for 500+ calls:
* **Requirement:** You must state that the call is "paid for by" or "authorized by" your committee or yourself.
* **Prohibition:** Anonymous robocalls are illegal.

#### Radio Ads
* **Requirement:** Must say "Ad paid for by [Committee Name]" clearly at the beginning or end of the ad.

#### TV Ads
* **Requirement:** Must show "Ad paid for by [Committee Name]" for at least **4 seconds**.
* **Size:** The font height must be at least 4% of the screen height.

## Part B: Rules for Independent & Primarily Formed Committees
These rules apply to **Super PACs**, **groups**, or **individuals** who spend money to support or oppose a candidate *independently* (without coordination). Because the candidate is not responsible for these ads, the disclosure rules are much stricter to prevent confusion.

### 1. What Requires a Disclosure?
Almost everything. Unlike candidates, independent committees must put disclosures on:
* Mailers & Emails.
* TV & Radio.
* **Billboards & Yard Signs.**
* **Door Hangers & Flyers.**
* **Posters & Newspaper Ads.**

### 2. The "Top 3 Funders" Rule
If you are an independent committee, you must list your **Top 3 Contributors** of $50,000 or more on your ads.
* **Format:** "Ad Committee Top Funders: [Name 1], [Name 2], [Name 3]".
* **Order:** Descending order (largest donor first).

### 3. The "Not Authorized" Rule
You must include a statement saying: **"This advertisement was not authorized by a candidate or a committee controlled by a candidate."**

### 4. Specific Formats for Independent Mailers
Independent mailers must follow a rigid design format:
* **The Box:** The disclosure must be inside a drawn box with a solid white background.
* **Location:** Bottom of at least one page.
* **Font:** Arial (or equivalent), at least **10-point type**.
* **Underlining:** Most of the text must be underlined (except the names of the top funders).
* **Wording:** "Ad paid for by [Committee Name]" ... "Ad Committee Top Funders [Names]" ... "This advertisement was not authorized..."

## Part C: Social Media & Internet Ads
The internet is treated differently depending on the platform.

### 1. Social Media Posts (Free)
If you or your volunteers post on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram for free, no disclosure is legally required (though transparency is good).

### 2. Paid Social Media Ads (Facebook/Instagram/etc.)
If you pay a platform to boost a post or run an ad:
* **The Platform Rule:** Most platforms have their own "Paid for by" label features. You must provide the platform with your committee info so they can display their standard label (e.g., "Sponsored - Paid for by Smith for Senate").
* **The Landing Page:** The ad usually links to your profile or website, which should have your full disclosure details.

### 3. Paid Influencers/Bloggers
If you pay an individual to post favorable content about you (or attack your opponent):
* **Requirement:** They must include a conspicuous disclosure on the post, such as "The author was paid by [Committee Name] in connection with this posting."

---

## Part D: Ballot Measure Ads (Paid Spokespersons)
Sometimes candidates run ads supporting or opposing ballot measures. If you hire a spokesperson for these ads, specific rules kick in.

### 1. The $5,000 Rule
If you pay an individual **$5,000 or more** to appear in a ballot measure ad:
* **Disclosure on Ad:** You must show/say: **"[Name] is being paid by this campaign or its contributors."**
* **Form 511:** You must file the **Paid Spokesperson Report (Form 511)** within 10 days.

### 2. The "Fake Doctor" Rule
If you pay an actor to portray a professional (doctor, nurse, firefighter, scientist) in a ballot measure ad, but they are *not* actually certified in that profession:
* **Disclosure on Ad:** You must state: **"Persons portraying members of an occupation in this advertisement are compensated spokespersons not necessarily employed in those occupations."**
* *Note:* If they actually *are* a doctor/nurse, you don't need this disclaimer, but keep proof of their license on file.

## FAQ: Common Questions

**Q: I am a candidate. Do I need to put "Paid for by" on my campaign buttons and pens?**
A: No. Small promotional items where a disclosure cannot be conveniently printed are exempt.

**Q: Do I need to put my Committee ID number on my yard signs?**
A: It is not legally required for candidates, but it is highly recommended. It makes it easier for the public (and the FPPC) to verify your committee.

**Q: I have a joint fundraiser with another candidate. Who pays for the invitation?**
A: If you split the cost, the invitation must list **both** committees in the "Paid for by" section.

**Q: I noticed a typo in my disclosure after the mailers were printed. What do I do?**
A: If they haven't mailed yet, sticker over it or reprint. If they have mailed, document the error and correct it immediately on the next batch. Persistent errors can lead to fines.

**Q: Does a candidate's personal Facebook page need a disclosure?**
A: Yes, if the candidate uses the page for campaigning or fundraising. The "Paid for by" disclosure should be on the Header Photo or Bio section.
