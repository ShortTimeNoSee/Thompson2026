# Chapter 2: Getting Started (The Paperwork)

**Official Source:** [Chapter 2 - Getting Started](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-2-Getting-Started.pdf)

## Introduction
This chapter covers the specific forms you must file to legally open your campaign committee. In California, you are considered a "candidate" the moment you announce your intention to run and start handling money.

The paperwork you file depends entirely on one magic number: **$2,000**.

---

## Path A: The "Small Player" (Less than $2,000)
If you do not plan to raise or spend $2,000 or more in a calendar year (including your own personal money), the process is very simple.

### The Forms You Need
1.  **Form 501 (Candidate Intention Statement):** File this before you raise or spend a single penny.
2.  **Form 470 (Short Form):** File this by the deadline of the first pre-election statement (usually a few months before the election). This form effectively tells the state, "I am staying small, don't expect complex reports from me."

**Trigger Warning:** If you later hit that $2,000 limit, you must immediately switch to **Path B** (see below) and file a **Form 470 Supplement** within 48 hours.

---

## Path B: The Standard Campaign ($2,000 or More)
Most serious campaigns will fall into this category. If you plan to raise or spend $2,000 or more (or if you are unsure), follow these steps.

### Step 1: File Form 501 (Candidate Intention)
**When:** BEFORE you solicit or receive any money (even your own).
**What it does:** Declares your intention to run for a specific office.
**Where to file:** Secretary of State.

**Critical Decision on Form 501:**
This is where you accept or reject the **Voluntary Expenditure Ceiling (VEC)** discussed in Chapter 1.
* **Check "Accept"** if you want to buy a candidate statement in the ballot pamphlet.
* **Check "Reject"** if you want to spend unlimited money but forfeit the ballot statement.
* *Note: If you run for reelection to the same office, you generally don't need a new Form 501 for the General if you filed one for the Primary.*

### Step 2: Open a Campaign Bank Account
**The One Account Rule:** You must have one separate bank account for each election.
* **No Commingling:** Never mix campaign money with personal funds or business accounts.
* **Deposit First:** If you want to spend your own money on the campaign, you must first deposit it into the campaign account, *then* spend it from there.
    * *Exceptions:* You can pay filing fees and the Statement of Organization fee directly from personal funds.
* **Tax ID:** The bank will ask for a Federal Tax ID (EIN). This is an IRS requirement, not an FPPC one, but you will need it to open the account.

### Step 3: File Form 410 (Statement of Organization)
**When:** Within **10 days** of raising or spending your first $2,000.
**What it does:** Registers your committee and gives you a Committee ID Number.
**Where to file:** Secretary of State.

**Key Rules for Form 410:**
1.  **Committee Name:** Must include your **Last Name**, **Office Sought**, and **Year of Election** (e.g., "Greer for Senate 2026").
2.  **Fees:** You must pay a **$50 annual fee** to the Secretary of State.
    * For new committees, pay within 15 days of filing Form 410.
    * Thereafter, pay by January 15 every year.
    * *Penalty:* Missing this payment results in a $150 fine (total $200) and potential enforcement action.
3.  **Treasurer:** You must list a treasurer. A candidate can be their own treasurer, but you cannot accept money if the treasurer position is vacant.
4.  **24-Hour Rule:** If you qualify as a committee (hit the $2,000 mark) during the last 16 days before an election, you must file Form 410 within **24 hours**.

### Step 4: Watch Out for Form 497 (The Speed Ticket)
Once you are a registered committee, you enter a zone of rapid reporting. **Form 497** is a 24-hour report used to disclose large contributions immediately.

**When to File Form 497:**
1.  **The 90-Day Window:** During the 90 days leading up to the election (plus election day), if you receive **$1,000 or more** from a single source, you must file Form 497 within **24 hours**.
2.  **Large Off-Cycle Donations:** If you receive **$5,000 or more** from a single source at any *other* time (outside the 90-day window), you must file Form 497 within **10 business days**.

**Electronic Filing:** Form 497 is filed electronically with the Secretary of State. No paper copies needed.

## Primarily Formed Committees (Non-Candidates)
This section applies to groups formed to support or oppose a candidate but **not controlled** by that candidate (e.g., "Citizens for Better Government, Supporting Smith for Senate").

**Requirements:**
1.  **Form 410:** File to register the committee.
    * **Name Rule:** Must include the candidate's name, office, year, and whether you **Support** or **Oppose** (e.g., "Committee Opposing Griffin for Governor 2026").
2.  **Form 497:** Applies to you as well. If you receive $1,000+ in the 90-day window, file within 24 hours.
3.  **Independent Expenditures:** Since you are not the candidate, your spending is likely an "Independent Expenditure." See Chapter 12 for those rules.

## How to File (Digital vs. Wet Signature)
As of 2023, the rules for filing paper forms (like Form 410 and 501) have modernized.

* **Email Filing:** You can file these forms via email to the Secretary of State.
* **Signatures:** You generally need a "verified digital signature" if filing by email.
* **Originals:** If you file online or by fax in a rush (like for a 24-hour deadline), you often still need to send the original paper copy with a "wet" (ink) signature or a compliant digital signature to the Secretary of State.

**Always check the [Secretary of State website](https://www.sos.ca.gov) for the current specific software requirements for digital signatures.**

## FAQ: Common Stumbling Blocks

**Q: Can I use my personal credit card for campaign expenses?**
A: Yes, but you must be reimbursed by the campaign bank account within strict timelines (usually 45 days) to avoid it becoming a complex "non-monetary contribution" or an illegal loan. It is cleaner to deposit your money into the campaign account and use the campaign debit card.

**Q: I am running for reelection. Do I need a new bank account?**
A: Yes. You need a separate bank account and committee for *each* election (e.g., 2022 Primary vs. 2026 Primary). You can transfer funds (see Chapter 1), but the accounts must be distinct.

**Q: What if I receive a $1,500 check 10 days before the election?**
A: You must file **Form 497** within 24 hours. If you fail to do this, you will likely be fined.

**Q: I'm a small candidate (Path A). What if I unexpectedly get a big donation and cross $2,000?**
A: You must file **Form 470 Supplement**, then file **Form 410**, open a bank account, and start filing regular reports (Form 460). You have 48 hours to file the supplement.
