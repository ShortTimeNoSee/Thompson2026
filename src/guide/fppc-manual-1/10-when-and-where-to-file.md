# Chapter 10: When and Where to File Form 460

**Official Source:** [Chapter 10 - When and Where to File Form 460](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-10-When-to-File-Form-460.pdf)

## Introduction
Filing your campaign statements on time is critical. The penalties for late filing are automatic and can add up quickly. This chapter explains the deadlines for filing your **Form 460** (Recipient Committee Campaign Statement) and tells you exactly where to send it.

**The Golden Rule:** If a deadline falls on a weekend or state holiday, you have until the next business day.

## Part A: When to File (Deadlines)

### 1. Semi-Annual Statements (Everyone Files These)
Every active committee must file a **Semi-Annual Statement**, regardless of whether you raised or spent money during that period. These are the two anchors of the campaign calendar.

* **Period Covered:** January 1 – June 30
    * **Deadline:** **July 31**
* **Period Covered:** July 1 – December 31
    * **Deadline:** **January 31**

*Note:* If you file a pre-election statement (see below), the "Period Covered" for your Semi-Annual Statement starts the day after your pre-election statement ended. It always connects perfectly—no gaps in dates allowed.

### 2. Pre-Election Statements (Election Years Only)
If you are a candidate listed on the ballot (or a primarily formed committee supporting/opposing one), you must file two additional reports *before* the election to give voters transparency right before they vote.

**For a June Primary Election:**
* **1st Pre-Election Statement:** Covers Jan 1 – mid-March. Filed in **March**.
* **2nd Pre-Election Statement:** Covers mid-March – mid-May. Filed in **May** (usually 12 days before the election).

**For a November General Election:**
* **1st Pre-Election Statement:** Covers July 1 – mid-September. Filed in **September**.
* **2nd Pre-Election Statement:** Covers mid-September – mid-October. Filed in **October** (usually 12 days before the election).

*Important:* The specific dates change every year. Always check the [FPPC Filing Schedule](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/campaign-rules/where-and-when-to-file-campaign-statements/filing-schedules.html) for the exact days.

### 3. The "24-Hour" Reports (Form 497)
While this chapter focuses on Form 460, remember that during the **90 days** before an election, you must file a **Form 497** within **24 hours** if you receive a contribution of **$1,000 or more**. This is a separate, rapid-fire deadline.

## Part B: Where to File

### State Candidates & Committees
If you are running for State Senate, Assembly, Governor, or other statewide offices:
* **Primary Filing Location:** **Secretary of State (SOS)**.
* **Electronic Filing:**
    * **Mandatory:** If you have raised or spent **$25,000 or more** cumulatively, you **must** file electronically using the Secretary of State's online system.
    * **Voluntary:** You can (and should) file electronically even if you are small. It's easier and cleaner.
* **Paper Filing:** Even if you file electronically, you may still need to file a paper copy with "wet" signatures (or a compliant digital signature) depending on current SOS rules. Always check the latest guidance.

**Address for Paper Filings:**
Secretary of State
Political Reform Division
1500 11th Street, Room 495
Sacramento, CA 95814

### Local Copies
* **State Candidates:** If you file electronically with the SOS, you generally do **not** need to file paper copies with your local county.
* **Exception:** If you do *not* file electronically with the SOS, you must file a copy with the county where you live (your "domicile").

### CalPERS and CalSTRS Candidates
* **Where to File:** You must file the original with the **Secretary of State** AND a copy with the **relevant Board's office** (CalPERS or CalSTRS) in Sacramento.
* **Electronic:** If you hit the $25,000 threshold, you must also file electronically with the SOS.

### Judges (Superior Court)
* **Where to File:** Secretary of State.
* **Note:** Even though Superior Court judges are local to a county, they file with the state.

## Part C: Fines and Penalties

### Late Fines
* **Standard Fine:** **$10 per day** that the report is late.
* **Double Trouble:** If you are required to file *both* electronically and on paper, and you miss both, you can be fined **$20 per day**.
* **Liability:** The candidate and the treasurer are personally liable for paying these fines. You generally cannot use campaign funds to pay fines resulting from negligence.

### Enforcement
If you simply refuse to file, the Secretary of State will refer you to the FPPC Enforcement Division. They can impose administrative penalties of up to **$5,000 per violation**.

## Action Plan: Filing Checklist

1.  **Check the Calendar:** Go to the FPPC website and print the "Filing Schedule" for your specific election (e.g., "State Candidates - November 2026 Election").
2.  **Mark Your Phone:** Set reminders 5 days before every deadline.
3.  **Check Your Totals:** Have you crossed the $25,000 threshold? If yes, ensure your electronic filing software is set up.
4.  **Signatures:** Ensure both the Treasurer and the Candidate sign the Form 460.
5.  **Delivery:**
    * **Electronic:** Hit "Submit" before midnight on the deadline.
    * **Paper:** Drop it in the mail (first class) by the deadline. It is considered filed on the **postmark date**. For the **2nd Pre-Election statement**, you must use **guaranteed overnight delivery** or personal delivery; regular mail is not allowed because it's too slow close to the election.

## FAQ: Common Questions

**Q: I didn't raise any money this period. Do I still have to file?**
A: **Yes.** You must file a Form 460 every semi-annual period until you formally terminate your committee. You simply report "$0" in contributions and expenditures.

**Q: I sent my report by mail on the deadline, but it arrived two days later. Am I late?**
A: No. As long as it was **postmarked** on or before the deadline, it is on time. (Exception: The 2nd Pre-Election statement requires overnight delivery).

**Q: Can I fax my report?**
A: Generally, no. Faxing is not a substitute for a proper filing.

**Q: I made a mistake on a past report. What do I do?**
A: File an **Amendment** to the Form 460 as soon as possible. Do not wait for the next deadline. Correcting it voluntarily is much better than waiting for an auditor to find it.
