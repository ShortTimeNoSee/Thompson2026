# Chapter 5: Contribution Restrictions (What You Cannot Accept)

**Official Source:** [Chapter 5 - Contribution Restrictions](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-5-Contribution-Restrictions.pdf)

## Introduction
While Chapter 4 defined what a contribution *is*, this chapter explains what contributions are **illegal**. Accepting the wrong kind of money—even accidentally—can lead to fines, returned funds, and legal headaches.

The golden rule of this chapter: **Know exactly who gave you the money.**

## Part A: The "True Source" Rule (Money Laundering)
It is a serious violation of the Political Reform Act to hide the true identity of a donor. In legal terms, this is called "campaign money laundering."

### What it looks like
You might think of money laundering as a complex crime, but in campaigns, it often looks like this:
* **Reimbursement:** An employer wants to donate to you but has hit their contribution limit. They give bonuses to five employees and ask them to donate to you.
* **"Straw Donors":** A wealthy individual gives money to their friend and tells the friend to write a check to your campaign.

**Your Responsibility:**
If a donor's behavior raises red flags (e.g., a receptionist writes a $5,000 check, or you get five checks from employees of the same company on the same day), you have a "duty to inquire." You must ask if they are the true source of the funds.
* **Consequence:** If you accept laundered funds, you must pay the entire amount to the **Secretary of State for the General Fund**. You do not get to keep it.

## Part B: Cash & Anonymous Contributions
Paper money is hard to track, so the state hates it.

### The $100 Cash Limit
* **The Rule:** You **cannot** accept cash contributions of **$100 or more**.
* **Includes:** Cash bills and coins.
* **Trigger Warning:** This applies to the *total* from a single source. A donor cannot give you $50 cash today and $50 cash tomorrow.
* **The Fix:** If you accidentally accept $100+ in cash, you must refund it within **72 hours** of receipt.
    * *Emergency Rule:* If you receive $1,000+ in cash during the last 90 days of an election, you must refund it within **48 hours**.

### Anonymous Donors
* **The Rule:** You cannot accept **$100 or more** from an anonymous source.
* **The Fix:** If you receive an anonymous $100 bill in a donation jar, you cannot keep it. You must send it to the **Secretary of State** for the General Fund.

### Money Orders & Cashier's Checks
* **The Rule:** You cannot accept contributions of **$100 or more** via money order or cashier's check.
* **Requirement:** Any contribution of $100+ must be by a **written instrument** (personal check, credit card, debit card, wire transfer) that contains the name of the donor.

## Part C: Lobbyist Restrictions
State lobbyists face strict rules because of their influence in Sacramento.

### The Ban
A state lobbyist **cannot** donate to you if they are registered to lobby the office you hold or are seeking.
* *Example:* A lobbyist registered to lobby the State Legislature cannot donate to a State Senate candidate.
* *Scope:* They also cannot donate to your local committee if you control one.

### No Home Fundraisers
A lobbyist (or their cohabitant) cannot host a fundraiser for you in their home or office if they are registered to lobby your agency.
* *Note:* A lobbying *firm* can host an event if the cost is $500 or less (see Chapter 4), but they cannot rent out their office to you as a venue.

## Part D: Pay-to-Play (Section 84308)
**Crucial for Incumbents and Appointed Officials**
This law, known as Section 84308, is designed to prevent "pay-to-play" politics. It applies to proceedings involving licenses, permits, or other entitlements (e.g., a developer asking for a building permit).

**Who it applies to:**
* Local elected officers (City Council, Supervisors).
* Appointed Commissioners (Planning Commission, LAFCO).
* Heads of state/local agencies.
* *Exempt:* Judges, Legislature, Constitutional Officers.

**The Restriction:**
If a proceeding involving a license/permit is pending before you (or was decided in the last 12 months):
1.  **You cannot accept** a contribution of **more than $250** from a party or participant in that proceeding.
2.  **You must disclose** any such contribution you received in the prior 12 months.
3.  **You must disqualify (recuse)** yourself from voting on the matter if you received >$250 from a party involved.

**The Cure:**
If you accidentally accept a contribution >$250 from someone with a permit pending before you, you can "cure" the violation (and still vote) if you return the money (or the portion over $250) within **30 days** of learning about it.

## Part E: Other Prohibitions

### Foreign Nationals
You cannot accept money from foreign nationals.
* *Source:* Federal Law (52 USCS 30121).
* *Definition:* Includes foreign governments, foreign political parties, and individuals who are not US citizens or permanent residents (green card holders).

### State Buildings
You cannot physically receive or deliver a contribution inside the **State Capitol** or any state office building.
* *Meaning:* Do not accept a check while standing in a hallway in the Capitol. Do not have mail sent to your government office.
* *Exception:* This does not apply to legislative *district* offices, only state buildings where the state pays the majority of the rent.

### Public Funds
You generally cannot use public money to run for office.
* *Example:* You cannot use your official government staff or office equipment to design campaign mailers.
