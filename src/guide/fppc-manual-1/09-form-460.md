# Chapter 9: The Main Report (Form 460)

**Official Source:** [Chapter 9 - Committee Report - Form 460](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-9-Form-460.pdf)

## Introduction
If you are running a campaign that raises or spends more than **$2,000**, the **Form 460** is your constant companion. Think of it as your campaign's general ledger or bank statement that you publish to the world.

This form tells the public three things:
1.  **Who gave you money.**
2.  **How you spent that money.**
3.  **How much cash you have left.**

Filing this form accurately is the core of California's transparency laws. Errors here are the most common source of fines.

## Who Must File Form 460?
You must file this form if you have a **controlled committee** (you are a candidate) or a **primarily formed committee** (supporting/opposing a candidate) and you have raised or spent **$2,000 or more** in a calendar year.

* **Note:** Once you trigger the $2,000 threshold and file your Form 410 (Statement of Organization), you must keep filing Form 460s periodically until you officially terminate the committee, even if you stop raising money.

## The Anatomy of Form 460
The form is broken down into a Cover Page, a Summary Page, and several "Schedules" (A through I). You generally fill out the Schedules first, then carry the totals to the Summary Page.

### The Cover Page
This is the "Face Sheet." It lists:
* **Filer Information:** Your committee name, address, and ID number.
* **Period Covered:** The specific dates this report covers (e.g., January 1 through June 30).
* **Verification:** You (and your treasurer) sign here under penalty of perjury to certify the report is true.

### Schedule A: Monetary Contributions (Money In)
This is where you list the checks and online donations you received.

**The Rules:**
1.  **Itemize over $100:** If a donor gives you **$100 or more** (cumulatively in a calendar year), you must list their:
    * Full Name
    * Street Address (No PO Boxes)
    * Occupation
    * Employer (or name of business if self-employed)
    * Amount received this period
    * **Cumulative Amount** (Total they have given you all calendar year)
    * **Per Election Total** (Total they have given for this specific election—Primary or General)
2.  **Under $100:** You do not need to list names for small donors (e.g., $25). You lump these together as "Unitemized Contributions" on the Summary Page.
3.  **Intermediaries:** If someone hands you a check from someone else, you must disclose both the true donor and the intermediary.

### Schedule B: Loans Received
This is where you list money you borrowed.
* **Includes:** Loans from banks, loans from supporters, and **loans from the candidate** (you) to the campaign.
* **Forgiveness:** If a lender tells you "don't worry about paying it back," that loan moves from Schedule B to Schedule A (it becomes a contribution).

### Schedule C: Non-Monetary Contributions (In-Kind)
This is for goods and services donated to you for free (or at a discount).
* **Valuation:** You must report the **Fair Market Value**. If a printer gives you \$1,000 worth of flyers for free, you report a \$1,000 non-monetary contribution.
* **Details:** You must list the donor's info (Name, Address, Occupation/Employer) just like a monetary contribution.

### Schedule D: Support/Opposition of Others
Use this **only** if your committee spent money to support or oppose *other* candidates or ballot measures.
* *Example:* You are running for Senate, but you donated \$500 to a friend running for School Board. You list that here.

### Schedule E: Payments Made (Expenditures)
This is your checkbook register. You list every payment you made.

**The Rules:**
1.  **Itemize over $100:** If you pay a vendor **$100 or more**, you must list:
    * Name and Address of Payee.
    * **Code or Description:** You must describe what you bought. The form has standardized codes (e.g., **LIT** for campaign literature, **CNS** for consultants, **OFC** for office expenses).
    * *Tip:* If you use a code, you usually don't need a written description unless the code is vague (like **OTH** for Other).
2.  **Under $100:** Lumped together as "Unitemized Expenditures."
3.  **Credit Cards:** If you pay the credit card bill, you must itemize the **sub-vendors** on Schedule E (or Schedule G) if a single purchase was $100+. You cannot just write "AmEx - $5,000." You must list the restaurants, airlines, and stores you paid via AmEx.

### Schedule F: Accrued Expenses (Unpaid Bills)
This is for debt. If you hired a consultant or bought mailers but **haven't paid the bill yet**, you list it here.
* **Why?** This prevents campaigns from hiding spending by simply not writing the check until after the election.
* **Process:** When you finally pay the bill later, you show the payment on Schedule E and reduce the debt on Schedule F.

### Schedule G: Payments by Agents
Use this if a campaign worker or consultant spent their own money and you reimbursed them.
* *Example:* Your campaign manager put a \$500 hotel room on their personal card. You reimburse the manager.
* **Reporting:** You list the manager as the payee on Schedule E, but you list the **hotel** on Schedule G so the public knows who actually received the money.

### Schedule H: Loans Made to Others
Use this if your campaign loaned money to another candidate or committee. (This is rare for standard candidate campaigns).

### Schedule I: Miscellaneous Increases to Cash
This is for money coming into your account that is **not** a campaign contribution.
* *Examples:* Interest earned on the bank account, a refund from a vendor (e.g., you overpaid the phone bill and they sent a check back), or selling an old computer.

## The Summary Page
This is the balance sheet where everything comes together. It has three columns:
1.  **Column A:** Total this period (from the Schedules you just filled out).
2.  **Column B:** Total from the *last* report's Column C (carryover).
3.  **Column C:** Cumulative total to date (A + B).

**Key Lines:**
* **Line 16 (Ending Cash Balance):** This number **MUST** match your bank statement balance (after adjusting for outstanding checks/deposits). If it doesn't match, you made a math error or missed a transaction.

---

## How to File
1.  **Electronic Filing:**
    * **State Candidates:** If you raise/spend **$25,000 or more**, you **must** file electronically with the Secretary of State using certified software.
    * **Voluntary:** You can file electronically even if you are under the limit (highly recommended).
2.  **Paper Filing:**
    * Even if you file electronically, the state often requires a paper copy with original "wet" signatures (or compliant digital signatures).
    * *Check Chapter 10 for specific deadlines and locations.*

## Action Plan: Completing the Form 460

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Gather Records** | Get your bank statements, check registers, credit card bills, and contributor lists for the specific reporting period. |
| **2** | **Code Expenses** | Go through your expenses and assign the 3-letter FPPC codes (LIT, TVL, SAL, etc.) to each one. |
| **3** | **Fill Schedules** | Complete Schedules A (Income) and E (Expenses) first, as they are the biggest. Then do the others. |
| **4** | **Check Sub-Vendors** | Did you pay a credit card or a consultant? Ensure you itemized the underlying purchases on Schedule G or E. |
| **5** | **Calculate Summary** | Add up the columns on the Summary Page. |
| **6** | **Bank Reconciliation** | Check Line 16 against your actual bank balance. If they don't match, find the error. |
| **7** | **Sign & File** | Treasurer and Candidate sign. File by the deadline. |

## Common Pitfalls
* **Missing Employer/Occupation:** If you don't have this for a $100+ donor within 60 days, you must return the money. Do not leave it blank.
* **The "Credit Card" Trap:** Listing "Chase Visa" as the payee without listing the restaurants and stores where the money was spent. This is a guaranteed audit finding.
* **Unpaid Bills:** Forgetting to list bills you owe but haven't paid yet (Schedule F).
* **Wrong Period:** Including transactions that happened *after* the closing date of the report. Stop exactly at the closing date.
* **Math Errors:** Column A (This Period) + Column B (Last Period) must equal Column C (Total).
