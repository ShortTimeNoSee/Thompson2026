If you go to iSideWith.com right now to see who matches your values for the 2026 California Governor's race, you won't find me.

It does not matter if you take the 30-minute policy quiz and agree with every single one of my positions. It does not matter if the algorithm calculates a 96% compatibility score between us. You will never see that number. The results page will simply hide my existence and serve you the next "best" option, likely a standard Republican or Democrat with a 52% match who doesn't actually share your principles.

This is because the platform has my campaign falsely flagged in their database as "Dropped Out."

This isn't just a matter of scrolling down to find my name. The site completely suppresses candidates with this status from the main results. To find me, you have to navigate away from your results, find a specific page detailing the chart of support for the race, and manually expand a hidden list of inactive candidates. Only there will you see my name, incorrectly labeled with a big red tag.

I haven't dropped out. I am an active, declared candidate. I am currently collecting signatures to get on the ballot. I am listed on the California Secretary of State's roster. I am on Ballotpedia. I am featured in the Libertarian Party of California's newsletter.

So why is one of the largest political data aggregators in the country telling their algorithm that my campaign is dead?

This isn't a new error. This designation has been incorrect for at least nine months. My team has emailed their support line. Peers and supporters who took the quiz and noticed my absense have emailed them. We have been met with total silence every single time.

In the tech world, we call this a data integrity failure. In politics, we call it election interference.

iSideWith is supposed to be the neutral ground. It is a tool where young voters go to escape the bias of mainstream media and find candidates who actually align with their specific policy views. By falsely flagging active candidates as "dropped out," they are interfering with the discovery process and artificially narrowing the field. They are taking voters who are looking for an alternative and steering them back toward the establishment options by hiding the very match they were looking for.

I am demanding that iSideWith.com correct their database to reflect my status as an **Active** candidate for California Governor, and do the same for all other active candidates that may have met the same fate.

Democracy requires accurate data. Right now, iSideWith is failing that basic test.
