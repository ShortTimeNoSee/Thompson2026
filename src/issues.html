                    <h4>If You Bought It, You Own It</h4>
                    <p>John Deere uses copyright to stop farmers from fixing their own tractors. Apple bricks your phone for using third-party parts. These are government-granted monopolies, not free markets. I will end the IP laws that turned you into a digital serf.</p>

                    <h4>Rights Aren't Granted</h4>
                    <p>The state thinks it grants you rights. It doesn't. From free speech to self-defense, your rights are pre-political. I'm not here to give you freedom. I'm here to stop Sacramento from taking it.</p>

                    <h4>End the Housing Cartel</h4>
                    <p>Sacramento created this housing crisis with their zoning codes and NIMBY regulations. Every "affordable housing" program is a band-aid on a wound they inflicted. Stop blocking development. Let people build homes. Get out of the way.</p>

                    <h4>You Shouldn't Need a Car</h4>
                    <p>The government forces you to drive by banning walkable neighborhoods and subsidizing highways. Car dependency is central planning with a different name. I'll legalize mixed-use zoning, end parking mandates, and let the market build the transit people actually want.</p>

                    <h4>Your Body, Your Choice</h4>
                    <p>The War on Drugs has been a 50-year failure that destroyed more lives than it saved. It militarized police, filled prisons with nonviolent offenders, and did nothing to stop addiction. Decriminalize. Treat addiction as health, not crime. End the war.</p>

                    <h4>Defend Yourself</h4>
                    <p>You have the absolute right to protect yourself and your family. Sacramento's gun laws don't stop criminals. All they do is disarm law-abiding citizens. The Second Amendment isn't negotiable. Restore your right to self-defense without begging for permission.</p>

                    <h4>Parents Over Bureaucrats</h4>
                    <p>Parents should decide how their children are educated. Not bureaucrats, not unions, not Sacramento. Fund students, not systems. School choice, homeschool freedom, and no more trapping kids in failing schools because of their zip code.</p>

                    <h4>Public Code for Public Money</h4>
                    <p>Every line of government software should be open source. You paid for it. You should own it, audit it, and reuse it. No more licensing fees to Microsoft with your tax dollars. No more black-box systems deciding your fate. If Sacramento builds it, Sacramento publishes the code.</p>
